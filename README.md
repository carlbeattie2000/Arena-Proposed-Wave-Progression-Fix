# Tarkov Arena Release Management

## Introduction

Battlestate Games (BSG) recently introduced the Arena feature in Tarkov, but the access to the game is being rolled out in waves. Originally perceived as a first-come, first-served basis, the process lacks clear communication from BSG, causing frustration among players. This project aims to address these issues by providing a more organized and transparent approach to managing the release.

## Motivation

The primary motivation behind this project is to offer a solution to the challenges presented by the phased release of Tarkov's Arena. The issues include extended waiting periods, uncertainty about the next wave, and a lack of communication from BSG. While the problem may seem minor, it presents an interesting opportunity to explore software and user experience solutions.

## Features

This project includes the following features to enhance the release management process:

- **Pre-slotted Waves:** Organize players into predetermined waves.
- **Timeframes:** Provide estimated timeframes for users before they are slotted into a wave.
- **Automatic Wave Grouping:** Dynamically create new waves based on time or order thresholds.
- **Wave Adjustment:** Flexibly adjust wave sizes by expanding or shrinking them automatically.
- **Wave Rescheduling:** Postpone or delay waves individually or collectively with various options.
- **Reduced Waiting Time:** Instantly grant access to specific waves or individual users.
- **Event-driven Communication:** Keep users informed through email notifications about any changes to their access slot.
- **Dynamic Wave Resizing:** Adjust wave group sizes based on events and changes.
- **Individual User Access:** Grant access to specific users.
- **Random User Access:** Provide access to a random selection of users across all waves.
- **Priority Access Criteria:** Implement criteria for prioritized access based on certain conditions.

## Implementation

While the project involves complex considerations and implementation challenges, it aims to simplify the user experience and improve the overall reaction to the game's phased release. By addressing issues such as communication, waiting times, and uncertainty, this implementation seeks to enhance the user experience during the Arena release.
